                <p>A state in India on the southwestern coast, known for its beaches, temples, and churches. Goa is India's smallest state by area and fourth-smallest by population. Goa is located in the western region of India. The state shares its borders with the Arabian Sea to the west, Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the south and the east. It is traditionally known as a tourist paradise for its natural scenery, unique beaches, and cultural diversity. In 2015 (till November), the state attracted 4.2 million tourists, including 0.41 million foreign visitors.
                    Goa goes through a very little temperature variation throughout the year, with around 28 degrees Celsius to 33 degrees Celsius (average maximum temperature). The monsoon acts vulnerable but the beauty it leaves after each shower is noteworthy. The Waterfalls can be seen flowing with great intensity with the help of monsoon, providing a spectacular view. 
                    The winter comes soon after, welcoming a crazy number of tourists in the state, from all around the globe.</p>
